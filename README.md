It is my project balcony.

For start work and see correct website use next -

0. in terminal write - npm i.
1. in terminal write - gulp.
2. then open new terminal, in terminal write - npx json-server db.json (on Windows). (leave gulp still working).

If it is does not work like expected, check if you done steps 1 and 2.
Notice - if you somehow try start from src folder and there are no style. change path in html to href="assets/css/style.css". (no min version in src, only in dist)

Here is working tabs, slides, calc, form, modal etc.
