For start work and see correct website use next -
0 in terminal - gulp
1) in directory src need to install webpack and JSON server.
2) then in directory src start json-server. On Windows, write in terminal -  npx json-server db.json
3) then open new terminal(leave json-server still working) and write in terminal - npx webpack.
Now all should work.

Here is working tabs, slides, calc, form, modal etc. In new version, I will delete unnecessary comments and update the site. Also will do min files and will make work correct dist.
